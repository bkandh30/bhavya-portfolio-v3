# Developer Portfolio

A modern, responsive developer portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, featuring smooth animations and an elegant design.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my professional experience, technical skills, education, and projects through a clean, single-page application with intuitive navigation and responsive design.

## Inspiration

This portfolio was inspired by Brittany Chiang's excellent developer portfolio design. Her work served as a creative reference for the overall aesthetic and layout approach.

- Portfolio: [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com)
- GitHub Repository: [github.com/bchiang7/v4](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)

I was particularly inspired by her clean UI/UX design principles and the thoughtful web interactivity present in her portfolio.

This project represents an original implementation built from scratch, with no code copied or reused from her repository.

It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Brittany Chiang.
